# The basic camera transform to return to for new parts

# The actual cube definition.  Since no instancing is supported, I will just 
# repeat this to create many cubes.  For extra credit, you can implement 
# instancing to make this simpler.  Alternatively, define a ray-cube 
# intersection test.
